I had significant difficulty getting my ASA to allow traffic from the public Internet into my DMZ. I think it has to do with how I configured dhcp on my public facing interface. For future occasions, I'm making notes about how I resolved this:

Initially, config was:
interface GigabitEthernet1/2
 nameif outside
 security-level 1
 ip address dhcp setroute

Had to apply "static ip address". I say static because its not a real static ip. I looked up the default gateway, public ip and subnet from the dhcp config:

_____________________________________________
# show route

Codes: L - local, C - connected, S - static, R - RIP, M - mobile, B - BGP
       D - EIGRP, EX - EIGRP external, O - OSPF, IA - OSPF inter area
       N1 - OSPF NSSA external type 1, N2 - OSPF NSSA external type 2
       E1 - OSPF external type 1, E2 - OSPF external type 2, V - VPN
       i - IS-IS, su - IS-IS summary, L1 - IS-IS level-1, L2 - IS-IS level-2
       ia - IS-IS inter area, * - candidate default, U - per-user static route
       o - ODR, P - periodic downloaded static route, + - replicated route
Gateway of last resort is <default gateway learned from dhcp> to network 0.0.0.0

S*       0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 [1/0] via <default gateway learned from dhcp>, outside

Configure a static route pointing to the learned gateway:
route outside 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 <default gateway learned from dhcp> 1

Next, configure a static nat:
object network <network object name>
 host <inside ip that will be mapped to public address>
 nat (DMZ,outside) static interface


access-list outside_access_in extended permit tcp any any eq <port> log notifications
access-list outside_access_in extended permit tcp any any eq <port> log
access-list outside_access_in extended deny ip any any


From time to time, when the IPS's DHCP lease expires, you may lose internet connectivity.
